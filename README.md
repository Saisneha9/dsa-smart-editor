# 📄 Smart Text Editor
Smart Text Editor — A lightweight Java-based text editor built entirely using DSA concepts like Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Linked Lists. It ensures efficient memory management, offers fast undo/redo, and provides smart auto-suggestions. A pure Java project showcasing real-world DSA application.
A *Java-based desktop text editor* that showcases the power of *Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)* — featuring undo/redo, auto-suggestions, edit history navigation, and file operations, all crafted with pure Java. This project is perfect for learners who want to apply DSA concepts in a real-world application.

## 🔍 What Makes It Stand Out?

✅ *Pure DSA Approach:* No external libraries, no fancy frameworks — just core Java and well-crafted data structures.

✅ *Educational Focus:* Ideal for students or developers learning how to apply stacks, tries, and linked lists in real applications.

✅ *Extendable Base:* You can easily enhance it with syntax highlighting, spell check, multi-tab support, or export options.

✅ *Cross-Platform:* Runs anywhere Java runs.
